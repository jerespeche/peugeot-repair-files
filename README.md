## Overview

This repository contains essential files aimed at resolving a prevalent issue experienced by owners of certain car models, where the vehicle's entertainment and navigation system's screen unexpectedly goes black. This glitch renders the radio and proximity sensors inoperative, accompanied by an erroneous sound resembling an attempt to eject a CD. This problem not only affects the usability of the system but also diminishes the overall driving experience.

## Compatibility

**PEUGEOT**: 308 - 408 - 508 - 2008 - 3008 - 5008 - RCZ

**CITROEN**: C3 - C3 AIRCROSS - C3 PICASSO - C4 LOUNGE - C4 PICASSO - C4 GRAND PICASSO

**DS**: DS - DS3 - DS4

## Usage:

- A Windows PC must be used (Do not use MAC nor Linux) with Windows XP or newer.
- Format a USB drive (Of good quality, from 2GB to 8GB in size) with FAT 32 format.
- If using a PC with Windows 8, 10, or 11, you must delete the hidden folder (system volume information) that these Windows versions automatically create on the USB drive upon formatting.
- To delete this folder, type in Windows search function (MAGNIFYING GLASS) CMD and press enter, then write rd "X:\system volume information" /s /q (REPLACE X WITH THE DRIVE LETTER OF THE USB).
- Copy the contents of the RT6-Soft folder (5 folders and 3 files) (DO NOT COPY THE ENTIRE RT6 SOFT FOLDER TO THE USB!!!) to the root of the USB drive (When opening the USB drive with the PC, you should only see 5 folders and 3 files).
- Insert the USB drive into the car's USB port (with the vehicle running).
- Allow it to read the information and repair, it takes 7 minutes to display the first image.
- Once the process is completed, the stereo turns back on normally, only remove the USB drive at that moment.

## Motivation
The decision to share these files publicly stems from my personal experience of having to pay a third party to obtain them, which I found to be unjust. Given that this issue arises from a software flaw within the car's system, it seemed unreasonable that owners should bear the cost of correcting a manufacturer's oversight. By providing these files at no cost, this repository aims to support car owners facing similar issues, promoting a community-driven solution to a problem that should not necessitate additional expenses.
